# Coding Experiment Instructions

Thank you for participating in our experiment! We hope it will be an interesting and helpful experience for you.

## Voluntary Participation

Your participation in this experiment is voluntary and you may choose to withdraw at any point. Completing both tests is required to qualify for the reward.

## Email Address Usage and Protection

We will tie your results to your email address only for the purposes of associating your results to a specific test and for sending you correspondence about the experiment. Once results have been sent to participants and the experiment has been completed in full, we will remove any and all personal information from our data.

## Risks

By participating in this study, you will be exposed to a test which may induce levels of stress typical to a quiz or minor exam in an academic environment.

By proceeding to take the test, you state that you understand the associated risks of this study are agreeing to participate.

## Instructions

You will be presented with several small coding tasks, one at a time. You will attempt to complete each problem as it is presented to you, and the test will automatically stop after 32 minutes. There are likely more tasks available than you will be able to complete successfully within the time limit. This is okay.

You will not be able to pull in third-party packages (like numpy), but will be required to complete the tasks using built-in features of the language you choose to use. You are welcome to use Python, Ruby, or JavaScript.

You have an option to participate in a demo task. This will not be counted against the 32 minutes you have to complete the tasks in the actual test.

Once your 32 minutes are up, the tasks that you attempted will be auto-graded. The results will also be sent to the researchers. We will send you a copy of your score after the experiment is over.
