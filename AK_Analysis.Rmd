summary(lmWithin)
```

Observations :
Control first is slighly statistically significant. This means that the order in which people saw test or control made a difference to their outcome. People who were in control first were likely to do a little worse. This could be because people who saw treatment first assumed treatment would continue ie there wasn't a sufficiently long washout period.

Observations:
- Control first does not show up as a significant variable in predicting week 1 test 1 score, or week 2 test 1 score amongst compliers.

summary(lmQ4)


```

Observations:
- For Q3, control scores are very similar in week 1 and 2. However, treatment scores are very different in week 1 and 2. Based on the regression, neither being in control or order (week 1 or 2) is statistically significant for the score on this test. Interestingly, year_experience is mildly significant. Although team size shows up as significant for a couple of sizes, the pattern of that with team size doesn't seem intuitive.

- For Q4, average scores in week 2 were lower whether it was test or control. In digging in further (see people with score < 100 below), some people just had a score of 0 on the test. All others had a score of 100. So this is likely noise. Again, neither control vs treat, nor being in week 1 or 2 shows up as siginificant for predicting the score on Q4.



```{r}
dt[(week1_attempted == 1) & (week2_attempted == 1) & (pre_task_treat == 1) & (Q4_score <100),.(subject_id,Q4_score)]
```
```{r}
dt$total_1to4_score = dt$w1_t12sum_score + dt$w2_t12sum_score

lm1to4score <- lm(total_1to4_score ~ upwork + berkeley_student + years_experience + age + team_size,data = dt[(week1_attempted == 1) & (week2_attempted == 1)])

summary(lm1to4score)

```

### Observations:

Looking at the total score, years of experinece and team size are statistically significant in predicting total scores amongst those who took both the tests. People with more years of experienceshave slightly higher scores +10, while people who have worked in small teams have lower scores. Note that we didn't randomize these variables, so we can't make causal interpretations here.
